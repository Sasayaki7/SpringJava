	<p>So you think you can just get away with spending millions and not pay it back huh? Think you can just get away not being a good contributor to society?</p>
	<p>Well here's a suggestion for you. Stop being a gambling addict, get a job and put yourself right. Spas and casinos, trying to get away with a life of laziness</p>
	<p>while we're out here sweating tears and blood every day 8 hours or more a day just so we can fend ourselves while leeches like you </p>
	<p>You're not going to win a million dollars going to a casino all day, keep dreaming lol it's not gonna happen.</p>
